25 February 2023 - 16 March 2023
I read the reference blog that is about the underlying physics rules. In these days mostly the backend of the project which is mostly about physics class was implemented. I followed them and made some additions to it.  
The requirements report is completed in this period. 

16 March 2023 - 25 April 2023
Since the backend of the projects was nearly completed, there were just some bugs to be fixed. These are resolved with additional classes that mostly include Math implementations.
Most of the game UI is implemented. These include hitButton, elevationBar, and the panel that shows where to hit the ball. There were also some additions and developments made in order to simplify the code. Sinc the UI design was nearly finished, the UI report was fairly easy to do.

25 April 2023 - 1 June 2023
The cueStick movement and its customization is done. The preview of cueBall and its placement displaying in the gameUI is added. It is implemented taking into account that it only happens when some special cases occur (when a foul happens). There is also a panel added in the 
gameUI to inform the user about a foul or game ending situation. The Detailed Design Report is done.
