Physics interface finalized with cue stick interactions being the last element. Moved on to refining the user interface. Many bug fixes and improvements to the project in all sorts of stuff. During the last week of this time, the software was finished with the implementation of the game rules and the score system done mostly by me.

I also oversaw the general development of the project during the development process.
